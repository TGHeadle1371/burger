# Eat Da Burger

-   Eat Da Burger is a burger eating app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

-   Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger name on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

-   Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

-   Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
